###Beijing Supreium Technology  Co.,Ltd   
March 2021— May 2021

Image Algorithm Intern,  Research & Development Center

- Responsible for the testing of new software: writing test plans and test cases, setting up a test environment, executing tests, and communicating and solving problems encountered during execution.
- Responsible for the defect detection of industrial castings: According to different types of data sets of customers, mark defects and image processing in an automatic/manual manner to form a standard data set, and use deep learning-based image segmentation algorithms (U-net) to complete defect detection.
- Assist algorithm engineers to improve and optimize existing algorithms and improve defect detection accuracy.

###Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences
October 2020—June 2021 

Algorithm Intern,  The State Key Laboratory for Management & Control of Complex Systems

- Participate in the "Multi modal-based Early Cognitive Impairment Screening and Rehabilitation in the Elderly" project
- Responsible for collecting EEG data, using Matlab related data package EEGLAB for data pre-processing (including segmentation, removing bad segments and bad electrodes, principal component analysis and other steps), and using pytorch-based deep learning network (Resnet, VGG) for automatic judgment of early cognitive impairment.
- By adding the convolution graph network structure, the network performance is improved and the recognition accuracy is improved.
