#####1999-2005

I was born in a small city in the north of China - Yuci District, Jinzhong City, Shanxi Province. The six years before I was born to primary school were the most carefree six years. My mother stayed with me every day, taught me to walk, taught me to eat, and taught me how to get along with others. Gradually, I had my own friends and hobbies.

#####2005-2014

Six years of elementary school and three years of junior high school. I like math, I like English, and I like Latin dancing. My favorite is the leisure time outside of class every Friday afternoon. We can choose to go out for hiking, learn musical instruments, paint, and bake, which allows me to explore a lot of new things while studying.

#####2014-2017

Go to college! As I wished, I entered a better local university and chose my favorite science subject to study. Gradually, I gained some awareness of my own future, and I began to think about where I would be and what I would do in the future. In the third year of high school, I have been studying hard and preparing for the college entrance examination. The summer of 2017 was the hardest, the most special and the most unforgettable.

#####2017-2021

The first time I stepped into the door of the university, I looked forward to a beautiful university life. I majored in intelligent science and technology at the University of Science and Technology Beijing, and I am very interested in this field and continue to explore. I started to lose weight during college and it worked great. On graduation day, my mother attended the graduation ceremony with me and witnessed an important moment in my life.

#####2021-present

Now, I'm a graduate student in electrical and computer engineering at Cornell University, and I'm making some definite plans for my future career while continuing to delve into my expertise. I will graduate at the end of this year, and my life is unfinished.
