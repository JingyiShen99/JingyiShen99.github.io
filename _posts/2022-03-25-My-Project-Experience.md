### Medical Image Landmark Localization using Deep Learning - MEng Independent Project  
##### November 2021—Present

- Identify and annotate the landmark locations in the image datasets.
- Research deep learning methods for landmark detection.
- Implement several deep learning methods and evaluate them on the datasets.

### Smart Guest Management System Based on Raspberry Pi4
##### October 2021—December 2021 

- We designed a smart guest management system that is intended to help public buildings such as apartment complexes and office buildings to improve management efficiency. 
- I mainly responsible for Identification of delivery package using YOLOv3; Setup access for Maintenance personnel using keypad; Storage and Retrieval of Food Delivery. 
- We write a HTML to present our design: [Smart Guest Management System](https://courses.ece.cornell.edu/ece5990/ECE5725_Fall2021_Projects/December%2014/Smart%20Guest%20Monitor%20System/Wednesday_js2825_ys566/index.html)

### Implementation of Underwater Image Enhancement Method - Graduation Project  
##### November 2020—May 2021

- Aiming at the problems of low resolution of underwater images and color distortion, the super-resolution algorithm based on Resnet and the color correction algorithm based on cGAN network are implemented respectively.
- Improve the enhancement effect by improving network structures and adjusting the experimental hyper-parameters, and use the image evaluation indicators such as SSIM and PSNR to analyze and evaluate the enhancement effect.
- An underwater image demonstration system is implemented using GUI design to realize algorithm visualization.
